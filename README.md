# Command Line Interface for Scala.js

`scalajs-cli` provides a Command Line Interface (CLI) to the Scala.js compiler
and linker.

Until Scala.js 1.0.0-M2, the CLI is part of the
[core repository of Scala.js](https://github.com/scala-js/scala-js).
This repository contains the CLI for later versions.
